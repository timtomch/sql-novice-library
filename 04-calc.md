The library is embarking on a digitization project. In order to estimate how long it would take to scan books, we want to look up what the total number of pages for all library books are. Prior experience has shown that due to poor quality binding, up to 2% of the pages will fail to be scanned for books published by Wiley and will have to be scanned anew. The total number of pages has therefore to be adjusted accordingly for this publisher.

Rather than modifying the stored data,
we can do this calculation on the fly
as part of our query:

~~~ {.sql}
SELECT 1.02*Pages FROM Works WHERE Publisher = "Wiley";
~~~

<table>
<TR><TH>1.02*Pages</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD>-null-</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>408.0</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>874.14</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>448.8</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>511.02</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>722.16</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>775.2</TD>
</TR>
</table>

Remember those empty cells we had in the database? Seems like one of them is showing up again here. We'll have to deal with it later so that it doesn't mess up our computations.

When we run the query, the expression `1.02 * Pages` is evaluated for each row. Expressions can use any of the fields, all of usual arithmetic operators, and a variety of common functions. (Exactly which ones depends on which database manager is being used.) For example, knowing that scanning two pages takes exactly 13 seconds, we can compute how many hours would be necessary to scan each Wiley book. Since this is an estimate, more than one decimal place doesn't make much sense and so we use a rounding function:

~~~ {.sql}
SELECT Title, round(13/2*(1.02*Pages)/3600,1) FROM Works WHERE Publisher = "Wiley";
~~~

<table>
<TR><TH>Title</TH>
<TH>round(13/2\*(1.02\*Pages)/3600,1)</TH>
</TR>

<TD>1.2</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Access 2013 all-in-one</TD>
<TD>1.3</TD>
</TR>
</table>

We can also combine values from different fields,
for example by using the string concatenation operator `||`:

~~~ {.sql}
SELECT Personal || " " || Family FROM Authors LIMIT 5;
~~~

<table>
<TR><TH>Personal || &quot; &quot; || Family</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Kevin E. Kline</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Daniel Kline</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Brand Hunt</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Allen G. Taylor</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD>Brett McLaughlin</TD>
</TR>

> ## Limiting Output {.callout}
>
> Note in passing the use of the `LIMIT` statement in the query above. This allows us to limit the number of
> rows that are returned by the query.

> ## Computing Scan Time for O'Reilly Titles {.challenge}
>
> After further testing, we realize that the average time to scan every two pages of books published by O'Reilly is 25 seconds, 
> because the operator seems to like reading a few paragraphs now and then.
> Fortunately, they do not suffer from the binding issue, though. 
> Write a query that returns the number of hours necessary to scan each O'Reilly book, given those circumstances.

> ## Unions {.challenge}
>
> The `UNION` operator combines the results of two queries:
>
> ~~~ {.sql}
> SELECT * FROM Works WHERE Publisher='Peachpit' UNION SELECT * FROM Works WHERE Publisher='Faber & Faber';
> ~~~

> ## Using ISBNs for Collection Analysis {.challenge}
>
> The `Works` table contains [ISBN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN) numbers that are either in 10-digit or 13-digit format. 
> The 13-digit numbers all start with the '978' prefix. The two digits following the prefix (or the first two digits in ISBN-10) 
> form the "registration group element" (to simplify: language or country), the next four digits are the "registrant element"
> (publisher) and the next three are the "publication element" (title). The last digit in both formats is a checksum character.
