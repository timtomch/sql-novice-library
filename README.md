sql-novice-library
=================

This is a modified version of the [Software Carpentry Intro to SQL lession](https://github.com/swcarpentry/sql-novice-survey), geared to library participants. It mostly differs in that it uses a simple bibliographic database, including a rudimentary authority file, instead of the default Antartica survey example.
